# Trigonometric
ICS3U
Type sin, cos, or tan. And watch the code make a graph. 
How the code works is included with the code. 
But in general
The first 4 lines import everything needed for the code to work. 
Then after putting it in a loop we ask for the trigonometric function they want. Which if it is a possible input the code stores it and breaks the loop.
Then the x values are generated. And the users input is then used to choose if it is sin, cos, or tan. 
The code below makes sure that if it is in tan that the lines are not connected.
Then the code below plots it all and makes it more understandable.
